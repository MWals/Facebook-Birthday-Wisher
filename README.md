# How I Use It

I have added this script to Startup Applications in my machine. So whenever I start my laptop, it will send the birthday greetings to those who their birthdays. And don't worry, it won't send birthday greetings twice in the same day, if you start your machine twice. 
 
Now you don‚Äôt have to Wish everyone daily on Facebook. üòÄ
